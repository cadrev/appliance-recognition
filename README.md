## Appliance Recognition
This is a simple project to practice and demonstrate the fullstack development of a Smart Plug IoT solution capable
of predicting an appliance in use. 
1. The model_training folder contains the script for training and dumping the machine learning model for appliance recognition.
2. The serial_predict folder contains the script for real-time data gathering of power consumption data and appliance prediction from the Smart Plug. 
3. The server-application contains the server application used to receive and visualize the power consumption and appliance prediction of the Smart Plug
